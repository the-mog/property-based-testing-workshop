# Property Based Testing Workshop

"Writing tests first forces you to think about the problem you're solving. Writing property-based tests forces you to think way harder." [@jessitron](https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/327480330900611072)

This is a simple workshop for teaching property based testing.

For more information, some great documentation & videos are available on the [ScalaCheck site](https://www.scalacheck.org/documentation.html).

This workshop is available for several languages:

* [Scala](./scala/README.md);
* Swift (coming soon).
* Ruby -  see https://github.com/kputnam/propr
